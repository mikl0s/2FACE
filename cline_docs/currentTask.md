   - Fixed keyboard input on default TOTP page
   - Implemented proper focus management
   - Added accessible focus indicators
   - Improved ARIA attributes
   - Enhanced keyboard interaction patterns

2. UI Improvements:
   - Enhanced focus styles matching design aesthetic
   - Improved visual feedback for keyboard users
   - Maintained theme consistency
   - Better accessibility without compromising design

## Current Challenges
1. Technical Limitations:

   - [ ] Create 4-digit input component
   - [ ] Implement auto-focus behavior
   - [ ] Add digit masking
   - [ ] Style current input highlight
   - [ ] Fix dark mode compatibility

2. TOTP Management:
   - [ ] Reorganize layout structure

   - More intuitive PIN entry
   - Better organized TOTP management
   - Clearer visual hierarchy
   - Consistent theming

2. Security:
   - Improved PIN input security
   - Better visual feedback
   - Clear input masking
   - Maintained sync functionality

3. Development:
   - Need to refactor PIN input
   - Update TOTP management layout
